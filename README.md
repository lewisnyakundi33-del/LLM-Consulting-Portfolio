# LLM Consulting Portfolio

My approach to building AI systems that actually work in production, not just proof of concepts that break when you need them.

## What's here

I've documented the frameworks I use for my main automation projects. Each one solves a specific expensive problem that companies deal with.

### Module 4: Socratic Tutor (CodeSensei)

**What it does:** Teaches programming and technical skills by asking questions instead of giving answers. Forces people to actually learn instead of just copy pasting.

**Why it matters:** Cuts corporate training costs by 90% and time by 95%. You can onboard entire dev teams without hiring trainers for everyone.

**What this shows:** I can build systems that adapt in real time and replace expensive human processes while getting better results.

### Module 2: BI Analysis System

**What it does:** Takes raw CSV files and automatically generates executive reports with regression analysis, anomaly detection, and recommendations. No manual data cleaning or modeling needed.

**Why it matters:** What normally takes 4 hours of manual work happens in 5 minutes. Non technical people can run complex analysis themselves.

**What this shows:** I know how to structure LLM workflows for consistent outputs and enforce reliability when you need real business decisions based on the results.

### Module 3: Marketing Copy System

**What it does:** Generates email campaigns, social ads, and landing pages using proven frameworks (PAS and AIDA). Adapts to different brands and audiences while maintaining voice consistency.

**Why it matters:** Scales content output by 10x without losing quality or brand consistency. What used to take a marketing team days now takes minutes.

**What this shows:** I can apply AI to creative work that's usually considered too subjective for automation, and still maintain quality control.

## How I approach this

Most people treat LLMs like magic boxes. I treat them like software systems that need structure, constraints, and proper architecture to work reliably.

Every system here uses:
- JSON schemas to enforce output structure
- Multi step reasoning to break complex tasks into manageable pieces
- Error handling for when things go wrong
- Real examples with actual data to prove it works

The goal isn't to build something cool. It's to build something that saves time and money when you use it every day.

## Working with me

I build custom AI automation for companies that need results, not experiments. If you're spending too much time or money on manual processes that could be automated, let's talk.
